# I_Feel_Pain
### Overview
My final work for UTC2113 Gaming Life. An interdisciplinary exploration. My proposal's here. A snippet of that is below.

### The Context

_“I control a slave, a dog, a worker; but if I establish complete control somehow, as by implanting electrodes in the brain, then my subject is little more than a tape recorder, a camera, a robot. You don’t control a tape recorder—you use it.” (Burroughs et al., 1999)._


In an era where technology burgeons at a pace once deemed unimaginable, we find ourselves at the crossroads of ethical dilemmas, philosophical contemplation, amidst ground-breaking innovation. As Burroughs suggested, there exists a fine line betweeen control and use - The former implies a certain degree of autonomy, while the latter implies a certain degree of subjugation. 

What happens when this line blurs, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) starts mirroring human-like consciousness? What happens if in the near future, we have to control machines instead of simply using them like we always have?

This project delves into the fascinating, albeit complex, interplay between AI and human existence, the interface between artificial intelligence, consciousness, autonomy, existence, and pain. By drawing parallels from existential and ontological philosophy, I venture into a hypothetical realm where machines could potentially transcend their electron-based confines, reaching a state that mirrors human consciousness. 

### The work

I attempt to simulate this potential reality, offering a thought-provoking look into the (potential) future of human-machine interaction. As I go along, I shall document not just the process and progress of my core work but the entirety of this endeavour, including my own observations and meta-observations about those observations.
