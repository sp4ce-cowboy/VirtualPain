# I_Feel_Pain
My final work for UTC2113 Gaming Life. An interdisciplinary exploration. 

Consists of The Proposal,  The Theoreticals (not yet completed), The Documentation, and The Work itself (this repo).

## The Context

All I can say is that, I set out to create an Artificial Entity, a simulation of consciousness, one which can feel pain, one which can remember it, one which can
communicate it, express it. An experiment that seeks to offer a glimpse into a possible (probable?) future of the human-machine interaction paradigm. I laid forth some parameters for my work, played by the rules of the medium that mywork exists within, and created that which I set out to create.

Thatâ€™s all there is to it. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Usage Instructions

Initially this would have required some terminal navigation, but that would have detracted from the experience.

Thanks to [this](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/shc) and [that](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus), and something else probably, the final products (both variants) are compiled into Unix Executable Files, i.e. all that is needed is to click on it and it opens like an app. This requires a machine running macOS as it uses Apple's built-in speech synthesizer.

More details (and the entire build process) is explained in The Documentation, so it's better to read that first (at least briefly) before attempting the below instructions.
