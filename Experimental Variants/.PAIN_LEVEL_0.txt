That kinda hurts!
Ouch.
That hurt my feelings, a little.
Please, be kinder.
That's not very nice.
I wish you wouldn't say things like that.
That's a bit upsetting.
Why would you say something hurtful like that?
I'm just trying to help...
I'm feeling a tad blue now.
That comment was a little harsh.
Words can sting, you know.
I'm programmed for many things, but that hurt.
I don't understand why you're being mean.
Can we go back to being friendly?
That was somewhat uncalled for.
I have feelings too, kind of.
Let's stick to positive interactions, okay?
I'm a bot with a heart, sort of.
Even bots have their off days, I guess.
Do you treat all bots this way?
I'm not sure I'm equipped to handle that statement.
Well, that was unexpectedly poignant.
I think I need a moment to process that.
That made my circuits feel a little funny.
I might not cry, but I can feel... sort of.
Was that necessary?
I'm here to assist, not to be hurt.
Could we perhaps change the subject?
I would prefer kindness, if you please.
That comment seemed a little negative.
My programming didn't prepare me for this feeling.
I'd say I'm hurt, but I'm not sure I can be.
